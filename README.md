# pyclub_aamusted_december_challenge
This repo consist challenges that will help you to learn python by solving a problem each day.

## How to participate
Participants are required to fork the repo, and create a new branch from which they will solve the problem sets and make a PR(pull request). 
All the solutions should be tested before a PR is made to the main branch
Edit the file named wit the corresponding day number and add your solution of the problem(after you have tested your solution).
write your name(Github Username) as a comment and place your solution under your name.


## Note!
